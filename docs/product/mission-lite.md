# Product Mission (Lite)

Devkit by Usual Expat is a Windows developer toolkit that helps developers, DevOps engineers, and power users set up a polished, efficient development environment in minutes by providing automated configuration for PowerShell, Git, and Azure DevOps pipelines.

The toolkit serves Windows developers who want fast, consistent dev environment setup without hours of manual configuration. Key differentiators include automated module installation, a beautiful Oh-My-Posh terminal theme, directory-based Git multi-profile support, and intelligent Azure DevOps pipeline generation that auto-detects .NET project types and Azure dependencies.
