# Spec Summary (Lite)

Create an interactive CLI installation wizard using PwshSpectreConsole that replaces hardcoded configuration templates. The wizard guides users through setting up Git profiles (with directory-based email switching), repository locations, PowerShell module selection, and Oh-My-Posh theme choice. Supports both fresh install and update modes, detecting existing configuration and showing current values as defaults.
